	<h1>Reading Response 2: 
	<br>Exercises in Style</h1>

	<p>Question 1</p>

	<p1>
	In the reading “Exercises in Style,” Raymond Queneau retells the same story 99 times. However, the story is not of matter nor is the language in which is read in. Should designers all together abandon imposing structure such structure and style on their pieces?
	</p1>

	<p>Question 2</p>
	
	<p1>
	Considering the statement, “Anybody can — and automatically does — describe different things in different ways,” (15) how does an outsider’s interpretation of a designer’s/artist’s art distort the narrative of that work? Does it even matter?
