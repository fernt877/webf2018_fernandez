	<h1>Reading Response 7: 
	<br>Interview w/Jürg Lehni</h1>

	<p>Question 1</p>

	<p1>
	Jurg Lehni describes that he perceives final outputs of his project to be: " [a] combination of the proposal of the machine...the moment of the output’s creation, plus the output,". This leads me to my question of how can designers reflect on this type of thinking and think beyond a single output?
	</p1>

	<p>Question 2</p>

	<p1>
	In the interview, Lehni mentions that every software has it's own gestures/character. To create a impactful site, should a designer be aware of that software's character/gestures even if their intended audience has no knowledge on them?
