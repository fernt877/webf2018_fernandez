	<h1>Reading Response 10: 
	<br>A Handmade Web</h1>

	<p>Question 1</p>

	<p1>
	In the reading, "A Handmade Web" J. R. Carpenter introduces the concept of the handmade web, which refers web pages coded by hand rather than software to challenge the conventions of design, writing, and reading. Have sites such as Squarespace deterred artists from creating handmade web? How will these tools affect the society's perception of web pages?
	</p1>

	<p>Question 2</p>

	<p1>
	J. R. Carpenter includes an interesting statement from Anil Dash, which says: "In the early days of the social web,there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by havingtheirown websites,instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity." Considering how prevalent social media is in today's society, what limitations do artists and designers face when they are forced to conform to standard profile format? Does Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat place any expectations upon its users?
