	<p>Question 1 </p>

	<p1>
	Considering the statement, “We are living through the peak moment of social media, and the construction of one’s image online is a chew-up topics,” (2) how is an artist’s work affected when it is presented on social media? Does the virtual environment of the platform take away from the work?
	</p1>

	<p>Question 2 </p>
	
	<p1>
	Due to the way in which images are commercialized on online platforms, how does an artist avoid such structures when they are the primary ways of circulation such as Facebook, Instagram, Google? Should the artist be learning to challenge such structures or embracing them?
