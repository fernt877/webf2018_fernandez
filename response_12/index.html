	<br>Relational Aesthetics</h1>

	<p>Question 1</p>

	<p1>
	As cities developed and became widespread, art also changed: "What  is collapsing  before  our  very  eyes  is  nothing  other  than  this  falsely  aristocratic  conception  of  the arrangement  of  works  of  art,  associated  with  the  feeling  of  territorial  acquisition,"." Considering this statement in mind, the ease of access to the internet is revoluntionary for society and individuals. How does this freedom contribute to the well-being of society?
	</p1>

	<p>Question 2</p>

	<p1>
	The author introduces an interesting perspective on form, stating: "In  order  to  create  a  world,  this encounter  must  be  a  lasting  one:  the  elements  forming  it  must  be  joined  together  in  a  form,  in other  words,  there  must  have  been  "a  setting  of  elements  on  one  another". When creating a webpage, designers are often forming their own mini worlds within the context of the ever-expanding internet. However, does a successful webpage need to interconnect all the elements within that world? Is it important for artist/designer to think about the limitations that will exist in their world as well?
